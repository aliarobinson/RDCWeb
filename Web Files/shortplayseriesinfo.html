<h1>The RDC Short Play Series</h1>
<p>Unlike the mainstage RDC productions, the Short Play Series is entirely student-driven. The short play series is performed 2 to 3 quarters each year, with each series typically consisting of 2 to 4 one-act plays. The short plays are student directed, and they may be student-written as well. Any interested Rose-Hulman student may direct or write a short play.</p>
<p>If you are interested in directing a short play: </p>
<ul>
<li>Please email <a href="mailto:hartnett@rose-hulman.edu">Dr. Hartnett</a> or one of the drama club officers to indicate your interest in directing. We have several one-act scripts available, and we will help you find and select a script.</li>
<li>You must commit to the role of director and decide on a script no later than the end of the quarter before the play will be performed.</li>
<li>Once you have decided on a short play to direct, please contact <a href="mailto:tryon@rose-hulman.edu">Dan Tryon</a> to ensure that the rights to the script are available.</li>
<li>If you wish to direct a student-written short play, it will not be necessary to purchase the rights to perform the script. However, a complete draft of the script must be ready before you may commit to directing this production.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in writing a short play: </p>
<ul>
<li>Please email <a href="mailto:hartnett@rose-hulman.edu">Dr. Hartnett</a> or one of the RDC officers with a draft of your script. We will help you find a student director to bring your script to the Hatfield stage.</li>
<li>Your script must be ready no later than the end of the quarter before the play will be performed. You may make edits to your script after this date, but the version submitted before this deadline needs to be a completed draft.</li>
<li>It is recommended that student writers do not direct their own scripts. However, this option is available if you wish to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>Auditions for the short plays will be announced to students via an all-campus email. These will typically take place no later than Week 3 of the quarter that the series will be performed. Auditions for the short plays are open to anyone in the Rose-Hulman community.</p>
